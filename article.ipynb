        "Zircon geothermometry is an important tool for estimating pre-eruptive temperatures in magmatic systems [@Putirka_2008]. Existing zircon geothermometers [@WATSON1983295; @boehnke2013zircon; @gervasoni2016zircon] are formulated using empirical models calibrated from experimental data on saturation conditions of zircon in magmatic silicate melts. In this paper we formulate an extension of the thermodynamic model for silicate liquids contained in rhyolite-MELTS [@gualda2012rhyolite;@ghiorso2015h;@ghiorso1995chemical] to account for the saturation state of zircon and related Zr-minerals as functions of temperature (T) and pressure (P) for compositions of naturally occuring magmatic liquids. We adopt thermodynamic properties of the zirconium-bearing minerals zircon and badeleyite from @robie1995thermodynamic and calibrate an internally consistent liquid model using the experimental data of @WATSON1983295 and @boehnke2013zircon. The resulting model is applied as a zircon geothermobarometer and is utilized to estimate saturation conditions of zircon in phase assemblages forming in silicic magmatic systems.\n",

        "## Model Formulation\n",
        "\n",
        "@ghiorso1995chemical posited a functional form for the Gibbs Free Energy of magmatic composition silicate liquids that was largely based on the model of @ghiorso1983gibbs. Their model assumes that the thermodynamic properties of naturally occuring silicate liquids can be approximated using simple multi-component regular solution theory on the predicate that thermodynamic components are appropriately chosen to represent \"mineral-like\" stoichiometric compounds. They calibrated this model using experimental phase equilibrium data. The silicate liquid model of @ghiorso1995chemical (hereafter, MELTS) was not altered in the development of the rhyolite-MELTS model [@gualda2012rhyolite] that extends MELTS to highly silicic magmatic compositions. The addition of oxidized carbon to the liquid model by @ghiorso2015h did require modification to the underlying thermodynamic formalism for the liquid phase. A thermodynamic component (CO<sub>2</sub>) and a dependent species (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) were added to account for the presence of both molecular CO<sub>2</sub> and carbonate in silicate melts. The addition of a carbonate species necessitated recasting of the regular solution model into a non-ideal assciated solution (@ghiorso2015h).\n",
        "\n",
        "The addition of Zr to the liquid model of @ghiorso2015h requires the selection of a Zr-bearing thermodynamic component. We adopt ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, because we assumed that Zr and Si form a strong association in the melt, and because the thermodynamic properties of the solid phase of equivalent stoichiometry (zircon) are well known [@robie1995thermodynamic]. Experimental studies [@watson1979zircon] and petrologiocal observations [@nicholls1969peralkaline] demonstrate that there is a strong relationship between the alkali-content of a melt and its capacity to hold Zr in solution under conditions of zircon saturation. In a series of elegant experiments on melts of widely varying alkali-contents, @watson1979zircon established that alkali-zirconate species of stoichiometry four alkalis to one Zr likely form. The formation of these species effectively lowers the mole fraction of ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> in the melt, thereby lowering that component's chemical potential, which has the effect of understaurating the melt in zircon. @watson1979zircon suggested that species Na<sub>4</sub>ZrSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and K<sub>4</sub>ZrSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> account for the sequestration of zirconium in alkali-rich magmas. It is interesting to note that the stoichiometry of these species is not reflected in the stoichiomtry of alkali-metal, zirconium-bearing minerals that form in magmatic systems (e.g. wadeite, Zr<sub>2</sub>K<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>, @carmichael1967mineralogy, nor to the supppsition of @linthout1984alkali that melt species of zirconium should likely reflect alkali-zirconate mineral stoichiometry.\n",

        "We consider four principal sources of experimental data on zircon saturation  for calibration of the model: (1) the original exploratory study of @watson1979zircon, (2) the followup study that constructed the first comprehensive calibration database by @WATSON1983295, (3) the study by @boehnke2013zircon that extended the experimental dataset to 2.5 GPa, and (4) the more recent study of @gervasoni2016zircon that focused on alkaline and aluminous melts. Of these four studies, the two of @WATSON1983295 and @boehnke2013zircon will be used for model parameter calibration. @watson1979zircon focused on understanding alakli-zirconate speciation in melts and to do so utilized synthetic-, compositionally-restricted systems. While his results are valuable in that they illuminate the effect of alakli content on zircon saturation, his liquid compositions lie outside of the applicable compositional domain of the MELTS model and consequently cannot be used to provide quantitative constraints.  The experimental study of @gervasoni2016zircon extends the compositional range of natural liquids beyond that investigated previously, however, the liquids underwent near 100% iron-loss to the capsules during each experimental run, raising the liklihood that the experiments never achieved equilibrium. Tellingly, the zircon saturation geothermometer calibrated by @gervasoni2016zircon yields results on meta-aluminous high silica rhyolites dramatically at odds with previous models based on the @WATSON1983295 and @boehnke2013zircon datasets. This observation suggests that the three datasets are mutually inconsistent, and we choose to utilize as calibrants the two studies whose results are less problematic.  \n",

        "\n",
        "(1) To be compatible with @ghiorso2015h (and consequently MELTS and rhyolite-MELTS) the standard state properties of all non-zirconium bearing liquid components and species will be adopted from @ghiorso1995chemical as modified by @ghiorso2015h. In addition, all regular solution interaction parameters not involving zirconium-bearing species will be adopted from the same source. By so doing we choose to render our Zr-liquid model calibration internally consistent with rhyolite-MELTS 1.1 [@ghiorso2015h], which permits calculation of mixed H<sub>2</sub>O-CO<sub>2</sub> fluid saturated melt, yet preserves phase equilibrium relations associated with the two-feldspar-quartz, water-saturated ternary minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) There are 19 species interaction parameters like $W_{ZrSiO_4, i}$, another 19 like $W_{Na_4ZrSi_2O_8, i}$, and another 19 like $W_{K_4ZrSi_2O_8, i}$. As there are not enough calibration data of sufficient compositional variability to constrain all but a few of them, we will assume that all 57 of these paramaters have values of zero. This assumption is supported by the observation that all naturally occuring magmatic liquids have low concentrations of Zr, making it a trace species of low mole fraction. Consequently, energetic contributions to the Gibbs Free energy via the regular solution terms involving zirconium-bearing species will be minimal; Henrian non-ideality will be accounted solely by the standard state and entropic terms in @eq-1 and @eq-2. \n",

This result runs contrary to the observation of Watson (1979 {cite}`WATSON1983295`) who concluded that alkali-zirconate speciation is independent of the identity of the alkali.

        "Quality of fit is evaluated in {numref}`_figure_1`, {numref}`_figure_2` and {numref}`_figure_3`. {numref}`_figure_1` demonstrates that residuals in zircon affinity show no correlation to alakli-content of the liquid, nor to temperature and pressure.  The lack of temperature and pressure dependence of residuals supports our simplifying assumption that $\\Delta S_{Na_4ZrSi_2O_8}$, $\\Delta S_{K_4ZrSi_2O_8}$, $\\Delta S_{K_4ZrSi_2O_8}$, and $\\Delta V_{K_4ZrSi_2O_8}$ may be set to zero. The absence of residual correlation to alkali-content implies that alkli-zirconate speciation accounts for the alkali-effect on the \"effective-concentration\" (i.e., the activity) of ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> in alkali-rich liquids. {numref}`_figure_2` demonstrates recovery of Zr liquid concentration, calculated by adjusting liquid Zr-content in order to zero zircon affinity, plotted against measured values. Estimated Zr concentrations scatter about a 1:1 line plotted against reported concentrations. There is no systematic change in scatter of predicted versus measured value as a function of Zr-concentration over two orders of magnitude. {numref}`_figure_3` illustrates recovery of priors residuals for the regression data set. While priors residuals are small (fall close to the green line) for typical Na/K melt ratios, there is significant deviation at elevated Na/K. The consequences of these deviations may effect recovery of zircon phase relations in phonolitic or pantelleritic composition melts with high Na/K, and this isue will be further examined below. \n",
